# Places
Places is a web application created using React for the frontend and NodeJS, Express and MongoDB for the backend.

The frontend was made from scratch. It utilized React context for global state managment, and not Redux due to the simplicity of the application. The styling is done using Styled Components. The application is optimized for mobile phones.

The backend was also made from scratch. It's a REST API made using NodeJS and Express, utilizing MVC and storing data to MongoDB with Mongoose. Express Validator is used for additional validation of the incoming data.
